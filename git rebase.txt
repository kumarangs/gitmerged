we have to do the regular steps till complete 2 commits an create a feature
branch and checkout feature branch and cretae a new file add fourth line :wq

rebase shoul be done in feature branch  
			
git rebase master
git rebased the master and feature branches in order
git branch
*dev
master
it will show all 4 commits in dev

git checkout master
git log
in master there r 3 commits {rebase is used to form line commits 1,2,3,4,5,6}

before merge we need to complete 2 conditions
git should be in maseter branch
git log shold be on sync

now git merge master
now master's 3commits and dev 4,5
meerged in to master 1,2,3,4,5 smooth merge done
git log 1->5 all in uniform line

we created feature branch to work and add in to master now we have merged our codes in master we 
can delete the feature branch 
git branch -d dev
-d[delete]dev
git branch
