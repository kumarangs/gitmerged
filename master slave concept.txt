there is concept of master and slave 
before that we need to know about public and private key
public key is like locker and private key is like a biometric key 
we can put any file in the locker and send it in group
other can encrpt the file in our publickey and send to us  
but the people with the private key can only open the lock and see the file from the group
its just like that.
in an instance machine microsoft and amazon create the private key and public key them selfs and 
give the private key to the user to save it in their system its RSA .
with this only we can open that instance
both this key will be in algorithm formate 
xxxxxlet see how we can create a public and private key xxxxxxxxxx
we can create a algorithm based pulic and private key using [putty gen ]

now consider we are in ubuntu machine
as ubuntu user we can check here by
ls -lrt
total 0 will be show here
because its just a list if [ls -a]
it will show all hidden files
in that there will a be .ssh file 
cd .ssh/
ls -a
there will be authorizedkey
cat authorizedkey

this is our publickey
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
we say all this because the master and slave machine need ssh connection
so we saw about public and private key
we can use user name pw after we pen the sysytem using private key

ssh ->is a port through server
int he master machine we craete 2files
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub
cp authorized_keys id_rsa.pub
we have copied the authorized key in to id_rsa.pub 
we should read aboud ssh connectivity in internetfor an idea
vi id_rsa
we copy our private key from our system and paste it here in insert mode
esc:wq
now this public and private key pair
now when we do ssh it will ask for these two
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
clear 
ls -lrt
we sshould change permission allow to use this machine
chmod 400 *
now only the ubuntu user can use the machine 
this part comes at 41min in jenkins video 3
consider we created master and slave vm machines in azure portal
now coming back to jenkins
go to manage jenkins->manage nodes and clouds->it will show master 
add ->new node from left coloum
it will save node name give machine name[slave machine] -permanent agent ->ok
now machine description 
number of executor [we can add according to the RAM]
IM ADDING 2
-remote root directory
go to machi add
mkdir jen
cd jen/
pwd
/home/ubuntu/jen
now our present working directory is this. now we taking this
add ot in remote root directory
this is were our job will run folder path for salve landing path
we have set this folder to store our data
-lables
we can add the project alias sbi
-launch agent method
->via ssh [WE USE SSH BUILD AGENT PlUGIN] its default plugin we addded . we can add if its not there
 -HOST = slave ip address

we need 3 details to connect with a machine 
*pub ip, *username,*pvt key  
credentials
kind
ssh username with privatekey 
username:ubuntu
privatekey:dsbfilgbfcer;oiubsoyhbewlagbcfuklyfb;iugtabueerqbljf
add 
-host key verification strategy
manually trusted key verifiaction strategy

save launching and connected will showp up
video time 49min jenkins 3video greens

once we connected both slave and master machine
go to slave machine 
when we check this list ls -lrt
remoting.jar 
remoting 
now new jar file and remoting apperar because our connection is successful

now we are gonna prove this 
go to jenkins -> create a new project 
slave test
->configure 
we can restrict this project to slave machine 
under GENERAL
[ok]restrict wherevthis project can run 
it will ask lable
[sbi (its our projrct)
now this project wil run on the lable where our sbi project stored9slave machine)

build ->execute shell in windows or linuxs based according to the local machine
date 
save

now we are gonna run the slavetest build
the build is successful
no go to slave machine 
hit ls- lrt
now there will be an extra [workspace ]created there
because our build is successful
50min only balance remaining
