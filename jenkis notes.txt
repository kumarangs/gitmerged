we need java to install jenkins,tomcat
jenkins is an integrating tool but it dont know how to integrate so we add plugins to integrate
with other tools.

to create a job
*create ->build steps ->excute shell->date ->save->dashboard ->build
sh comands works only in linux not in windows
weather reports shows our status[it will only show last 5 builds]

x)now queing of jobs
x)now we create 3jobs 
1)dev,test,prod 
2)now we gonna create alink btw these 3 by ->configure-> post build action
in that we add test SAVE
3)AFTER that in post buid action-> select build other projects in the call prod ->save
now we success fully created a squence to call these 3 jobs one after another in automation

x)now call dev it will automatically call test after test complete prod will start this is squence

There is UPSTREAM & DOWNSTREAM projects
1st upstrem = dev->test->prod
upstream of test = dev 
downstream of test = prod

we can set trigger in post build actions in many ways automatically with conditions applied by us. like build periodically
build periodically *****[ cron tab ]
*min *hr *day *month *year 
remote trigger
http://localhost:8083/JENKINS_URL/job/dev/build?token=12345
its jenkins url and trigger code we copy them both and host to start the build

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
now we see about manage and assign roles

we need users to assign users permission 
first go to manage user +create user -> user1 = bose user2 -> sakthi
nowe we need to set permissions for users
go to manage roles 
*global roles [all employes] 
*item roles [specif dep dev, test,hr,manager etc]
we can give readonly permission to all employes 

now we need group item roles
role to add [developer]
pattern [cron regex] dev.* its a patern seraching algorithm .all projects start with dev will have same permissions 
like [dev - team1 ,dev -team2, dev -team3] but [des -team1, des- team2] wont get permission
there will be 100 of projects handled in a system so we use this pattern set to segregate permission with [regex].* experssion
testsbi.* = testsbi -team 1, testsbi -team 2 [testitc -team 1 ,testitc -team2 ]wont have permission

project start with dev will have full access for developers
same for test get full access for tester 

in manage and assign roles
we should set item roles for the user 
user1 [ok] developer [x] tester
user2 [x] deveeloper [ok] tester

user 1 will have all developer based projects only 
user 2 will have accsess to tester based projects only

when we sign in from those accts we can see the diff in the accts of those dashbords
there wont be any build and edit options for denied projects

TOMCAT INSTALLATION GUIDE FOR LINUX SYSTEM
tomcat is used to deploy java based application jar war ear
its a place to run java code [dev will give java code]

tar file is a commpressed file
when tar we download tomcat it will be in this format
we have to extract it
in linux machine [tar -xvzf apache tomcat-7.0.109.tar.gz]
we can google it for the command
it will de commpress it 
ls -lrt
we can see it inside
in linux we have a file directory [google it for explanation images]
/bin/ essential user command binaries
/dev/ divice files
/etc/ host specific system configuration
/home/ user home directories
/lib/ essential shared libraries
/opt/ add-on application software packages
/var/ variable files [m installs will be here ]apt install will store here
/root/ home direc for the root user

so now
mv apache /opt/
cd opt/
ls -lrt
tomact moved here
cd apache-tomcat/
ls -lrt
so many files will be show 
4 folders are important
/opt/apache->
-web apps
-logs
-config
-bin [binary]

TO START TOM CAT 
cd bin/
ls -lrt
startup.sh will be there 
to run shell script 
sh startup[filename] or ./filename
tomcat started
xxxxxxxx [to change localhost server of tomcat ]xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
cd conf/
ls -lrt
server.xml
vi server.xml
down below <connector port 8080 protocol =http [we can change port 8082,83]
will be there we can edit this to change the port for tom cat
esc:wq
cmd : wget file name or link
war file will download here
deloyment process

xxxxxx now how to change jenkins port number xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
clear
PATH cd etc/ if its empty then go ,cd default/ but etc/ is commom for most sysyems 
ls-lrt
jenkis will be there
vi jenkins
port for HTTP connector (default 8080)
HTTP_PORT = 808_ WE CAN EDIT THIS TO CHANGE PORT NUMBER
ETC:WQ
WE HAVE TO RESTART FOR IT TO ACTIVATE
in linux cmd = service jenkins stop 
service jenkins start
in jenkins
download a sample java war file from internet for tomcat deploy
go to programdata/jenkins/.jenkins folder in windows
for linux cd/var/lib/jenkins/
ls -lrt
cd workspace/
ls -lrt
all the projects will be listed here
importantly the project appear here only after when we hit build it jenkins
cd projectname/
full path:var/lib/jenkins/workspace/projectname# cp /root/sample.war .[root folder la iruka sample war file copy panni currentpath konduva]
ls -lrt
sample war file will show up
ithu ethukuna just for proof to show we have the samplein jenkins workspace
now jenkins will do the deployment 
get back to dashbord
search in internet
jenkins plugins to integrate tomcat
deploy to container [plugin] helps to integrate with
xtomcat
xjboss
xglassfish

now go to dashbord and install the deploy to container
no go to ->project -> post build and add deploy war /ear file
{now we r gonna do the deployment activity}
war/ear files?
[sample.war this is the files name                                     ]
if we have already took sample war to workspace so we dont need to give path/else :var/lib/jenkins/workspace/projectname
CONTEXT PATH
[/sample]
CONTAINERS
[we can select the tomcat version we have]tomcat 8
TOMCAT URL
HTTP IP ADRESS PORT [8082]IS MINE
NXT IS PERMISSION WE have to set the credentials for autth person only to access this
we can google the steps or ask tariner later
once user credentials and pw: given
SAVE 
NOW WE satrt the build schedule
there will be an error occur 
we look the solution in google for solution
webapps/manager/META-IF/ [IN THIS PATH]
ls -lrt
context.xml file will appear
vi context.xml
and add few extra lines we got from google and save it
now restart tomcat
./shutdown.sh
./startup.sh
now hit build project again
build succes
HTTP IP ADRESS PORT [8082]we chek here the file will run in this tomcat server

we told there are 4 folders important 

-web apps
-logs -> logs
-config -> user/port
-bin [binary] ->start/stop

cd webapps /
ls -lrt
we can see sample.war here this was the file we gave to jenkins to deploy it did the deployment automation
so the file came to webapps
we can do this manaully but we need to do this auto mode

task - jenkins version ?using cli
CLI EXAMPLE
git =git init
docker = docker run 

2 -EMAIL NOTIFICATION ENABLE VIDEOS AVAILABLE IN JENKINS 3 VID LAST 10MIN
3 -CREDENTIALS ACCT And pw will be stored in credentials find the pw locations
