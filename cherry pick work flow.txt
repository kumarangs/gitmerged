mkdir cherry
cd cherry/
git init in local
vi test-> first line
git add test
git commit -m "first commit" ->master branch created
git branch dev
git checkout dev
vi test
finish second and third commit process
now the test team said please merge only the second commit
now we need cherry pick to do that

git checkout dev
git log
we need the commit id to ussse in cherry pick

git checkout master
git log
we only have 1commit

git cherry-pick commit id [second id]
inserted
git log

if we merge all commits will be added but in [cherry pick we can do that one by one only]
